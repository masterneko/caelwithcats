# About me
[Blog](https://masterneko.github.io)

I am a C++ programmer and have a pet cat named Ack. Currently in high school. I have a passion for code and want to figure out how things work.

## What have I made?
* [bin-edit](https://github.com/masterneko/bin-edit) Heard of hex editors? This is like that except you edit entirely in 0s and 1s.
* [ackOS](https://github.com/ackOS-project/ackOS) - An ambitious operating system project I was trying to write. While not completed it has provided an avenue for understanding the complexities of computers
